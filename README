Run it with:

    $ RUST_LOG=deadlock_repro=info cargo run

and eventually, the program will hang (after a variable number of calls to
`block_on`).

The reproduction code includes `env_logger`, so it's also possible to see
debug/trace logs from the threadpool. This might be useful for debugging
the deadlock.
